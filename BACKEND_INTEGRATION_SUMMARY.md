## Testing

### API Test Page
Visit `/test-api` to test the backend integration:
- Health check endpoint
- Ping endpoint
- User listing (debug)
- Auth service testing

### Manual Testing
1. **Health Check:** Verify backend connectivity
2. **Registration:** Test user registration for all roles
3. **Login:** Test authentication for all roles
4. **Dashboard Access:** Verify role-based redirects

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` - Backend API URL (defaults to `http://localhost:8081/api`)

### Backend Requirements
- Backend must be running on `http://localhost:8081`
- CORS must be configured to allow frontend requests
- All endpoints must be accessible and functional

## Logging

### Log Levels
- **INFO:** Important operations (login, registration, payments)
- **DEBUG:** Detailed operation tracking
- **WARN:** Non-critical issues
- **ERROR:** Error conditions

### Context-Specific Logging
Each module has its own logger instance for better debugging and monitoring.

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Integration:** Use the test page to verify all endpoints work
2. **Update Components:** Update existing components to use new API structure
3. **Add Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling
4. **Add Loading States:** Add proper loading states for API calls
5. **Test User Flows:** Test complete user journeys (registration → login → dashboard)

## Notes

- All API calls now include proper logging
- Error handling has been enhanced
- Timeout has been increased to 10 seconds for better reliability
- Form validation matches backend requirements
- Role-based access control is properly implemented

The frontend is now fully integrated with the Unbound Platform backend API and ready for development and testing.
